##Must-Have Features

###World map 

* World map with country lines, suitable projection, zoom and drag functionality

* Conflict locations as circles (two sizes, depending on conflict intensity)

* Mouseover function to display countries involved in conflict

* Map filtered according to events and filters from other elements/sections

###Temporal plots

* Curve or area plot showing number of conflics over time 

* Gantt-like timeline showing conflict durations over time.

* Brushable area for period filter

* Filtered according to events and filters from other elements/sections

###Statistical graph

* Bar chart (or other chart type) 

* Showing at least one key statistic derived from the data (e.g., top 10 countries with highest number of conflict years)

* Filtered according to events and filters from other elements/sections


###Filter section

* Conflict intensity (pulldown menu)

* Conflict type (pulldown menu) 

* Conflict source (pulldown menu) 

* Region of the world (pulldown menu) 

* Location/country (pulldown, search box, or other)


##Optional Features

* Additional curve or area plot showing estimated number of deaths over time

* Additional encoding of information.  For instance, the conflict types could be encoded by coloring circles on the map and/or the bars on timeline.  Additional prototyping is required to figure what would work best...

* Additional statistics derived from data and displayed

* Some visual feature focusing on adversarial or allied countries (e.g., pairs of countries that have conflicted with each other the most often during a given period)
