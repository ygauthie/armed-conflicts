**Project Proposal : Visualizing Modern History Armed Conflicts**
-----------------------------

**Background and Motivation**
-----------------------------
*Discuss your motivations and reasons for choosing this project, especially any background or research interests that may have influenced your decision.*

I work as a defence scientist for the Department of National Defence in Canada, so I am interest in  military topics. I considered many project ideas, but few of them do not require the use of classified or sensitive data.  In the end, I decided to concentrate on the recent history (post-WWII) of armed conflicts in the world, a topic that is fully unclassified and has many interesting spatial and temporal components that can be displayed through an interactive visualization.


**Project Objectives**
---------------------
*Provide the primary questions you are trying to answer with your visualization. What would you like to learn and accomplish? List the benefits.*

Hundreds of armed conflicts have occured in the world since World War II (WWII).  This is a lot of data for anybody to grasp.  I want to produce an interactive visualization that will effectively convey information and allow users to answer the following questions:
* Where in the world (countries and/or regions) have conflicts occurred since WWII?
* Has there been any trend in the frequency of modern conflicts, either  worldwide or in specific countries/regions of interest?
* Do these trends, if any, differ depending on the type and intensity of the conflict?




**Data**
---------
*From where and how are you collecting your data? If appropriate, provide a link to your data sources.*
I intend to use the [Armed Conflict Dataset](http://www.pcr.uu.se/research/ucdp/datasets/ucdp_prio_armed_conflict_dataset/) compiled by the University of Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP) and the International Peace Research Institute, Oslo (PRIO).

Data Processing. Do you expect to do substantial data cleanup? What quantities do you plan to derive from your data? How will data processing be implemented?
Visualization. How will you display your data? Provide some general ideas that you have for the visualization design. Include sketches of your design.
Must-Have Features. These are features without which you would consider your project to be a failure.
Optional Features. Those features which you consider would be nice to have, but not critical.
Project Schedule. Make sure that you plan your work so that you can avoid a big rush right before the final project deadline, and delegate different modules and responsibilities among your team members. Write this in terms of weekly deadlines.
