**Project Proposal : Visualizing Modern History Armed Conflicts**
-----------------------------

**Background and Motivation**
-----------------------------
*Discuss your motivations and reasons for choosing this project, especially any background or research interests that may have influenced your decision.*

I work as a defence scientist for the Department of National Defence in Canada, so I am interest in  military topics. I considered many project ideas, but few of them do not require the use of classified or sensitive data.  In the end, I decided to concentrate on the recent history (post-WWII) of armed conflicts in the world.





Project Objectives. Provide the primary questions you are trying to answer with your visualization. What would you like to learn and accomplish? List the benefits.
Data. From where and how are you collecting your data? If appropriate, provide a link to your data sources.
Data Processing. Do you expect to do substantial data cleanup? What quantities do you plan to derive from your data? How will data processing be implemented?
Visualization. How will you display your data? Provide some general ideas that you have for the visualization design. Include sketches of your design.
Must-Have Features. These are features without which you would consider your project to be a failure.
Optional Features. Those features which you consider would be nice to have, but not critical.
Project Schedule. Make sure that you plan your work so that you can avoid a big rush right before the final project deadline, and delegate different modules and responsibilities among your team members. Write this in terms of weekly deadlines.
